# Stepper_Motor
-This project utilizes Atmega32 microcontroller,keypad,LCD (16x2)character,DC_Motor and Stepper_Motor  
# Driver Implemented:  
1-DIO driver    
2-LCD driver    
3-KEYPAD driver  
4-Stepper_Motor driver
# How it works ?
-when you enter the correct password , it takes you to the next window and you only have 3 attempts to try it.If you enter the password incorrectly more than 3 times,the system will shut down for 5 seconds.  
-The Next window have Three choose first DC_Motor if you choose it it will take you to the next window,second Stepper_MotorThird if you choose it it will take you to the next and third Exit and if you choose it it you will Exit the system.  
-If you choose DC_motor and the next window opend, this window contain four choices:  
1-for Rotate CW  
2-for Rotate CCW  
3-For STOP  
4-press any key to take you to the previous window  
-If you choose Stepper_Motor and the next window opend, in this window you shall enter your rotating angle and then choose direction:  
1-for Rotate CW  
2-for Rotate CCW
